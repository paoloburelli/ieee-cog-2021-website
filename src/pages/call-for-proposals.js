        <h2>Call for Tutorials</h2>
        <div className="section">
          <p>We invite submissions for tutorials to be held at IEEE CoG 2021. This is an opportunity for you to share
            your
            expertise and influence future research directions in the CoG community. Tutorials can be on any topic in
            the
            scope of the conference. Please note that the conference's scope includes all technical research areas as
            they
            intersect with games. We especially encourage tutorials that reflect and respond to this broader scope. For
            a
            partial list of topics relevant to the expanded scope of the conference, please visit Topics and Tracks</p>

          <p>Typically, tutorials are expected to run for 1.5 hours, but longer ones will also be considered. The format
            may be negotiated through the Tutorial Chairs.</p>

          <p>Proposals should include the following information:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Title</li>

            <li>List of presenters with contact details and short biographical details (less than 150 words for each
              presenter)
            </li>
            <li>Outline of topic coverage and format of tutorial (less than 400 words in total)</li>
            <li>Links to the presenter/organizer web page or the tutorial page (optional)</li>
            <li>Duration and logistical requirements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proposals should be sent by email to the Tutorial Chairs by January 14th 2021 or sooner. Notification of
            acceptance will take place by February 12th.</p>

          <p>Email proposals and enquiries to both Tutorial Chairs: Jesper Juul (<Link
            to="mailto:j@jesperjuul.net">j@jesperjuul.net</Link>) and Sebastian Risi
            (<Link to="mailto:sebr@itu.dk">sebr@itu.dk</Link>).</p>

        <h2>Call for Competitions</h2>
        <div className="section">
          <p>The CoG 2021 Organising Committee invites proposals for competitions to be held at the conference. These
            may be completely new ones or competitions held already in the last years, possibly at other venues.
            Proposals
            are due by January 14th 2021, and will be reviewed based on their relevance to the CoG community. Please see
            the
            topics covered by the CoG conference. Competitions can be based on well-known games as well, but
            competitions
            based on custom-made and lesser-known games are also welcome. The competition needs to define a set of rules
            and objectives for determining the score of each player.</p>

          <p>To submit your proposal, send an email with the title "CoG 2021 Competition Proposal" to the competition
            chairs Ruck Thawonmas (<Link
              to="mailto:ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp">ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp</Link>) and Antonios Liapis (<Link
              to="mailto:antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt">antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt</Link>).</p>

          <p>Please, include the following information with your proposal:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Organisers’ names.</li>
            <li>Competition title.</li>
            <li>Description of the competition (about 200 words).</li>
            <li>Web address.</li>
            <li>Whether the competition will have several tracks or not, and if they should be considered different
              competitions or a single one.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Additionally, the following item can be submitted with the proposal or later:</p>


          <ul>
            <li>Video of the competition/tracks (see below).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please, also note the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><Link to="https://twitter.com/StudentGameCOMP">The IEEE CIS Student Game-Based Competition Sub-Committee
              (SGBC)</Link> has determined, in agreement with the Games
              TC meeting held at CIG 2017, that all competitions (including all tracks) must provide a short video for
              entrants. Competitions that do not provide this video will not be accepted at CoG 2021. However,
              submission of
              the video is not necessary for the proposal but can be deferred to after provisional acceptance of the
              competition. This requirement applies to both new and old competitions. The objective of creating these
              videos
              is to raise the general quality of our competitions and attract as many participants as possible by
              providing
              an easier start with the respective frameworks. The duration of the video is to be decided by the
              organizers,
              but it should have (English) subtitles to aid non-native English speakers. The content should demo
              concepts
              like how to install the required software packages, write an entry for the competition and submission
              instructions. The rationale is that if the whole process can be shown in less than 5 minutes, participants
              will feel more encouraged to participate and prepare a submission for the contest.
            </li>
            <li>We will of course provide certificates for all competitions and we will try to make some price money
              available, but we also encourage the organizers to look for financial sponsorship to make their
              competition
              more attractive.
            </li>
            <li>Competition papers. These are regular papers (up to 8 pages) that describe one or more entries to the
              competitions that are running at this year’s CIG. Competition papers need to include evaluation of the
              contribution, including (if possible) results on the same benchmark as that used by the competition, and
              comparison to other competition entries. Because the problem domain is well-known, these papers can be
              reviewed faster than regular papers. The same quality standards will apply to competition papers as to
              regular
              papers. Competition papers should be submitted by 28th May 2021. The competitions do not need to be
              accompanied by competition papers; a competition can run even in the absence of any submitted papers.

              accepted, you must also provide a list of reviewers sufficient to your expected submissions.
            </li>
            <li>Sponsor Biographies – each sponsor should include a brief biography that demonstrates professional
              excellence and qualification to review for the special session. The bio should include a current e-mail
              address.

              session. The draft call for papers should not fill more than one page.
            </li>
          </ul>

            promptly, and placed on the
            conference web site, in part to prevent duplicate submissions. If someone has beaten you to the punch,
            contact them and offer to serve as a member of their review panel.
