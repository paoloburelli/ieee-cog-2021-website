    <div class="news"><p><strong>June 29th:</strong> The final decision for auxiliary papers have been finally
      communicated to all authors. To accommodate for the delayed notification, we have postponed the deadline for
      camera-ready submission and speaker registration to July the 5th at midnight anywhere on earth.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="news"><p><strong>May 28th:</strong> Registrations are open! please check the <a
      href="#registration_section">registration</a> section for all the details and the link to the registration page.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="news"><p><strong>May 27th:</strong> As submissions to the auxiliary tracks keep on coming in, we are
      turning
      the 250 submissions milestone. One behalf of the whole organising committee, I would like to thank you all for
      the overwhelming interest and the great submissions.</p>
      <p>To both facilitate the flow of submissions and ensure the quality of the review process, we decided to adjust
        the upcoming
        deadlines as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>May 31st: Auxiliary tracks submission deadline</li>
        <li>June 21st: Auxiliary tracks notification of acceptance</li>
        <li>July 5th: Camera ready copy deadline and author/speaker registration deadline</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="news" style="display: none"><p><strong>April 26th:</strong> After the overwhelming success of the main
      call for papers (we had
      more
      then 200 submissions) it is time the next deadline. The deadline for short/demo/competiton/vision papers and for
      presentation proposals is on May 31st and the submission page is now open at <a
        href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeecog2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeecog2021</a>
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="news" style="display: none"><p><strong>April 7th:</strong> In light of the challenges that many
      researches face during this
      period and to accommodate the many requests received, the full paper submission deadline has been extended by one
      week. The new deadline is on the 16th of April at midnight anywhere on earth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="news" style="display: none"><p><strong>March 19th:</strong> Due to the current state of the pandemic
      around the world and
      the uncertainty about future travel safety
      and restrictions, this year's Conference on Games will be fully virtual.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Games offer a limitless domain for computational creativity, design, technology, education, social sciences, and
      artificial intelligence. The annual IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) is a unique forum for cutting-edge research
      related to game technologies and design, covering scientific, technical, social and human aspects of games.</p>
    <p>CoG was expressly launched to reflect the changing nature of games as technology and media; where concerns merge,
      overlap, and cross-pollinate. Beginning as an evolution of the Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games
      (CIG) and later joined by the International Conference on Virtual Worlds and Games for Serious Applications
      (VS-Games), CoG brings together leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, to share recent
      advances and co-create future directions.</p>
    <p>This year’s edition of CoG continues forging the path of attracting an evermore competent and diverse audience.
      Alongside our traditional types of submission (articles for peer review intended to be included in the conference
      proceedings), we seek proposals for presentations from both academia and industry in the form of abstracts.
      Furthermore, it is also possible to apply to present work previously published in the IEEE Transactions on Games
      journal.</p>

    <p>We welcome papers and presentations related to all aspects of Games, including, but not limited to, the following
      broad subject areas:</p>

    <p class="tags">
      <mark>AI&nbsp;for&nbsp;Playing&nbsp;Games</mark>
      <mark>Analytics,&nbsp;Player&nbsp;Modelling and Player Psychology</mark>
      <mark>Artificial Intelligence for Novel Game Interactions</mark>
      <mark>Benchmarks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Competitions</mark>
      <mark>Game Studies and Game Culture</mark>
      <mark>Game&nbsp;Design</mark>
      <mark>Game&nbsp;Human Computer Interaction</mark>
      <mark>Game&nbsp;Theory&nbsp;and&nbsp;Multi-agent&nbsp;Systems</mark>
      <mark>Narrative&nbsp;and&nbsp;Interactive&nbsp;Entertainment</mark>
      <mark>Procedural Content Generation&nbsp;and&nbsp;AI&nbsp;for&nbsp;Game&nbsp;Design</mark>
      <mark>Applications of Games and Game Technology</mark>
      <mark>Virtual&nbsp;and&nbsp;Augmented&nbsp;Reality in Games</mark>
    </p>

    <p>In particular, this year, we encourage submissions that span across -- or hybridise -- multiple of these subject
      areas.</p>

            <p>The CoG 2021 Organising Committee invites proposals for competitions to be held at the conference. These
              may be completely new ones or competitions held already in the last years, possibly at other venues.
              Proposals are due by January 14th 2021, and will be reviewed based on their relevance to the CoG
              community. Please see the topics covered by the CoG conference. Competitions can be based on well-known
              games as well, but competitions based on custom-made and lesser-known games are also welcome. The
              competition needs to define a set of rules and objectives for determining the score of each player.</p>
            <p>To submit your proposal, send an email with the title "CoG 2021 Competition Proposal" to the competition
              chairs Ruck Thawonmas (<a href="mailto:ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp">ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp</a>) and Antonios
              Liapis (<a href="mailto:antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt">antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt</a>).</p>
            <p>Please, include the following information with your proposal:</p>

            <ul class="dashed">
              <li>Organisers’ names;</li>
              <li>Competition title;</li>
              <li>Web address;</li>
              <li>Description of the competition (about 200 words);</li>
              <li>Whether the competition will have several tracks or not, and if they should be considered different
                competitions or a single one.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Additionally, the following item can be submitted with the proposal or later:</p>

            <ul class="dashed">
              <li>Video of the competition/tracks (see below).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please, also note the following:</p>

            <ol class="spaced">
              <li>The IEEE CIS Student Game-Based Competition Sub-Committee (SGBC) has determined, in agreement with the
                Games TC meeting held at CIG 2017, that all competitions (including all tracks) must provide a short
                video for entrants. Competitions that do not provide this video will not be accepted at CoG 2021.
                However, submission of the video is not necessary for the proposal but can be deferred to after
                provisional acceptance of the competition. This requirement applies to both new and old competitions.
                The objective of creating these videos is to raise the general quality of our competitions and attract
                as many participants as possible by providing an easier start with the respective frameworks. The
                duration of the video is to be decided by the organizers, but it should have (English) subtitles to aid
                non-native English speakers. The content should demo concepts like how to install the required software
                packages, write an entry for the competition and submission instructions. The rationale is that if the
                whole process can be shown in less than 5 minutes, participants will feel more encouraged to participate
                and prepare a submission for the contest;
              </li>
              <li>We will of course provide certificates for all competitions and we will try to make some price money
                available, but we also encourage the organizers to look for financial sponsorship to make their
                competition more attractive;
              </li>
              <li>Competition papers. These are regular papers (up to 8 pages) that describe one or more entries to the
                competitions that are running at this year’s CIG. Competition papers need to include evaluation of the
                contribution, including (if possible) results on the same benchmark as that used by the competition, and
                comparison to other competition entries. Because the problem domain is well-known, these papers can be
                reviewed faster than regular papers. The same quality standards will apply to competition papers as to
                regular papers. Competition papers should be submitted by 31st May 2021. The competitions do not need to
                be accompanied by competition papers; a competition can run even in the absence of any submitted papers.

        <!-- <h7><a href="https://youtu.be/6qv_pzeYoOU">Video</a></h7>   -->

        <p>This competition focuses on a variation of the classic Snakes game to provide an entertaining environment of
          studying and teaching artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Snakes is an arcade
          game in which two players control their respective snakes, attempting to collect the most number of apples
          while manoeuvring its way to avoid collisions with each other or leaving the board. Participants are requested
          to submit the implementation of the bot that operates its respective snake, using the API provided and simple
          specifications. The tournament will happen in a round-robin format, in which two participants play against
          each other ten times. At each match, snakes capture apples to increase their sizes. After 2 minutes, the
          longest snake wins; unless your opponent dies before. ;) The champion is the participant whose bot achieves
          the highest winning ratio among the participants. Snakes game has been designed to facilitate and encourage
          the use of AI, ML and other advanced computational techniques by first and second-year students in
          university-level courses of Computer Science.</p>

        <p>Space Invaders is a classic arcade game in which the player protects Earth against invading ships by shooting
          at them and avoiding enemy attacks. In this competition, participants must develop an AI bot that must defeat
          invaders in the shortest time with fewer shots. Available resources will include JSON files with data that can
          enable training Machine Learning models. There will be two tracks: (1) the moves of the invaders are cyclical
          and predictable; (2) movements of invaders are irregular.The source code has been developed and will be made
          publicly available on GitHub.</p>

        <!-- <p>This competition focuses on a variation of the classic Snakes game to provide an entertaining environment of studying and teaching artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Snakes is an arcade game in which two players control their respective snakes, attempting to collect the most number of apples while manoeuvring its way to avoid collisions with each other or leaving the board. Participants are requested to submit the implementation of the bot that operates its respective snake, using the API provided and simple specifications. The tournament will happen in a round-robin format, in which two participants play against each other ten times. At each match, snakes capture apples to increase their sizes. After 2 minutes, the longest snake wins; unless your opponent dies before. ;) The champion is the participant whose bot achieves the highest winning ratio among the participants. Snakes game has been designed to facilitate and encourage the use of AI, ML and other advanced computational techniques by first and second-year students in university-level courses of Computer Science.</p> -->

        <p>CARLE is the name of the environment for Carle's Game, and stands for Cellular Automata Reinforcement
          Learning Environment. This environment is a cellular automata (CA) simulator with support for arbitrary "Game
          of Life"-like CA based on born/survive rules applied to cells' Moore neighborhoods. It's implemented in
          PyTorch and runs relatively fast, nearly 10,000 CA updates with vectorization on a run-of-the-mill laptop with
          just 4 threads.</p>
        <p>Agents have the ability to toggle any and all cells in a 32x32 grid in the center of the default 64x64
          universe. Although formulated as a reinforcement learning environment, the environment returns no nonzero
          reward or done signal; participants will be challenged to exploit the environments open-endedness and add
          constraints and exploratory reward functions to teach agents to be curious and creative.</p>
        <p>Judging can consist of quantitative metrics such as duration of aperiodic dynamism after last toggling cells,
          and qualitative judging (people's choice/judging panel), and agents will be trained and tested on 4 to 8 CA
          rule sets with interesting characteristics. The final test round will incorporate rule sets not disclosed
          during training, making for a particularly strong challenge to participants.</p>

        <h7><a href="https://youtu.be/ELrsLzX3qBY">Video</a></h7>

        <p>ColorShapeLinks is an AI competition for the Simplexity board game with arbitrary game dimensions. The first
          player to place n pieces of the same type in a row wins. In this regard, the base game, with a 6 x 7 board and
          n = 4, is similar to Connect Four. However, the type of piece is defined not only by color, but also by shape.
          Shape can be round or square. Round or white pieces offer the win to player 1, while square or red pieces do
          the same for player 2. Contrary to color, players start the game with pieces of both shapes. This means that a
          less observant player can lose in its turn, especially since shape has priority over color as a winning
          condition. Given this fact, as well as the arbitrary game dimensions, the challenges for the AI, namely at the
          level of the heuristic evaluation function, are multifold.</p>

        <p>The Dota 2 5v5 AI Competition challenges participants to code a bot that beats the Dire (destroys the Dire’s
          Ancient) in the shortest time possible!
          The competition runs on the original Dota 2 game, thanks to the Dota 2 5v5 Framework, that let’s you develop,
          deploy, and run your own python program that controls the 5 heroes in the Radiant team, against the built-in
          AI.</p>
        <p>Your bot will play as the Radiant. You can freely choose 5 among all the available 115 heroes for your
          team.</p>
        <p>Your bot will face the built-in Dire AI in a standard Dota 2 5v5 match. The heroes in the Dire team will be
          randomly chosen among the remaining heroes.</p>
        <p>The winner will be the fastest bot at destroying the Dire’s Ancient. The framework saves the time elapsed
          from the match start to the Ancient’s destruction event, which will determine the competition winner.</p>

          associated to each of the three character types: Zen, Garnet, and Lud where the character data of the last two
          characters are not revealed. Standard League considers the winner of a round as the one with the hit point
          (HP) above zero at the time its opponent's HP has reached zero. In Speedrunning League, the league winner of a
          given character type is the AI with the shortest average time to beat our sample MCTS AI. The competition
          winner is decided considering both leagues' results based on the 2015 Formula-1 scoring system.</p>

        <p>Following up on the idea of the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition, we propose the General Strategy
          Game AI competition as a new and interesting challenge. While the complexity of GVGAI games has been limited,
          strategy games feature search trees of exceptional breadth and depth. In comparison, to existing strategy game
          competitions, our competition will focus on the development of a single agent which is capable of playing
          multiple strategy games with varying characteristics. Those include but are not limited to, turn-based vs.
          real-time strategy games, completely observable vs. partial information games, and a varying set of units,
          levels, abilities and game-modes.</p>

          href="https://gaigresearch.github.io/afm/competition">https://gaigresearch.github.io/afm/competition</a>/</p>

        <!-- <p>Since Michael Buro motivated AI research in real-time strategy games, multiple games and frameworks have been proposed and used by investigators in the field. These games, although different in themes, rules and goals, share certain characteristics that make them interesting for Game AI research. Most of the work done in this area pertains to the sub-genre of real-time strategy games (and, in particular, to Starcraft), but it is possible to find abundant research in other real-time and turn-based strategy games.</p>

Stratega allows the creation of a wide variety of turn-based and real-time strategy games using a common API for agent development. Game components are defined using a YAML configuration file which makes the creation of new games and their balancing very simple. The framework has been built with stochastic forward planning agents in mind and supports full access to a game’s forward model, which has been optimized in terms of simulation speed.</p> -->

          The main research contribution of the competition is not how to optimally plan and play games but rather how
          to create playtesting methods that are conditioned by aggregated player behaviour data across millions of
          players.</p>

        <p>We provide a modified version of the game that enables simulating the main gameplay as well as data
          (completion rate, move limit) on the given levels.
          The participants are expected to create a playtesting agent which can match the player completion rate of a
          level. By using the number of moves spent by the agent to complete a given level across several attempts, the
          completion rate is then determined by calculating the fraction of attempts that finish within a given move
          limit.
          They are allowed to make use of the simulator and player data in any way they can otherwise.</p>

        <p>Their method will be evaluated on a number of held-out levels which include both previous and new mechanics.
          The winner will be the one that achieves the lowest mean relative error in completion rate on the evaluation

        <p>Several AI competitions organized around RTS games have been organized in the past (such as the ORTS
          competitions, and the StarCraft AI competitions), which has spurred a new wave of research in to RTS AI.
          However, as it has been reported numerous times, developing bots for RTS games such as StarCraft involves a
          very large amount of engineering, which often relegates the research aspects of the competition to a second
          plane. The microRTS competition has been created to motivate research in the basic research questions
          underlying the development of AI for RTS games, while minimizing the amount of engineering required to
          participate. Also, a key difference with respect to the StarCraft competition is that the AIs have access to a
          "forward model" (i.e., a simulator), with which they can simulate the effect of actions or plans, thus
          allowing for planning and game-tree search techniques to be developed easily. This will be the fifth edition
          of the competition.</p>

        <p>IEEE CoG StarCraft competitions have seen quite some progress in the development and evolution of new
          StarCraft bots. For the evolution of the bots, participants used various approaches for making AI bots and it
          has fertilized game AI and methods such as HMM, Bayesian model, CBR, Potential fields, and reinforcement
          learning. However, it is still quite challenging to develop AI for the game because it should handle a number
          of units and buildings while considering resource management and high-level tactics. The purpose of this
          competition is developing RTS game AI and solving challenging issues on RTS game AI such as uncertainty,
          real-time process, managing units. Participants are submitting the bots using BWAPI to play 1v1 StarCraft
          matches.</p>

        <p>Legends of Code and Magic (LOCM) is a small implementation of a Strategy Card Game, designed to perform AI
          research. Its advantage over the real cardgame AI engines is that it is much simpler to handle by the agents,
          and thus allows testing more sophisticated algorithms and quickly implement theoretical ideas.</p>
        <p>All cards effects are deterministic, thus the nondeterminism is introduced only by the ordering of cards and
          unknown opponent's deck. The game board consists of two lines (similarly as in TES:Legends), so it favors
          deeper strategic thinking. Also, LOCM is based on the fair arena mode, i.e., before every game, both players
          create their decks secretly from the symmetrical yet limited choices. Because of that, the deckbuilding is
          dynamic and cannot be simply reduced to using human-created top-meta decks.</p>
        <p>This competition aims to play the same role for Hearthstone AI Competition as microRTS plays for various
          StarCraft AI contests. Encourage advanced research, free of drawbacks of working with the full-fledged game.
          In this domain, it means i.a. embedding deckbuilding into the game itself (limiting the usage of premade
          decks), and allowing efficient search beyond the one turn depth.</p>
        <p>The contest is based on the LOCM 1.2, the same as in CEC 2019 Competition. One-lane, 1.0 version of the game,
          has been used for CodinGame contest in August 2018.</p>

        <h5><a href="http://aibirds.org/" target="_blank">6th Angry Birds Level Generation</a>
        </h5>

        <h7><a href="https://youtu.be/Aul6F9cia7M">Video</a></h7>

        <p>This year we will run our sixth Angry Birds Level Generation Competition. The goal of this competition is to
          build computer programs that can automatically create fun and challenging Angry Birds levels. The difficulty
          of this competition compared to similar competitions is that the generated levels must be stable under
          gravity, robust in the sense that a single action should not destroy large parts of the generated structure,
          and most importantly, the levels should be fun to play, visually interesting and challenging to solve.
          Participants will be able to ensure solvability and difficulty of their levels by using open source Angry
          Birds AI agents that were developed for the Angry Birds AI competition. This competition will evaluate each
          level generator based on the overall fun or enjoyment factor of the levels it creates. Aside from the main
          prize for “most enjoyable levels”, two additional prizes for “most aesthetic levels” and “most challenging
          levels” will also be awarded. This evaluation will be done by an impartial panel of judges. Restrictions will
          be placed on what objects can be used in the generated levels (in order to prevent pre-generation of levels).
          We will generate 100 levels for each submitted generator and randomly select a fraction of those for the
          competition. There will be a penalty if levels are too similar. Each entrant will be evaluated for all prizes.
          More details on the competition rules and can be found on the competition website aibirds.org. The competition
          will be based on the physics game implementation “Science Birds” by Lucas Ferreira using Unity3D.</p>

    <p>We are looking for sponsors that help us build a strong conference and
      community for research in games. Most of the attendees and participants of game events benefit from tailored
      career opportunities presented at the conferences. We intend to support the young professionals to such career
      opportunities at IEEE CoG.</p>

    <p>IEEE CoG provides a unique platform for industrial sponsors to present themselves to potential employees in the
      area of games with expertise in AI, Computational Intelligence, Design and Games Technology. Our participants’
      expertise goes even beyond a developer‘s profession. We have the following statistics from previous IEEE CIS
      conferences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Professors and experts in AI and computer games: 20%</li>
      <li>Researchers and young professionals: 60%</li>
      <li>Graduate and undergraduate students: 20%</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By sponsoring you will be helping us organize the best possible conference and experience for professionals,
      researchers, speakers, guests and delegates.</p>

    <p>What’s in it for a sponsor? It will give you access and positive branding for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Leading game research groups</li>
      <li>Investment in R&D for game companies</li>
      <li>Students, researchers and professionals that attend the conference</li>
      <li>Recruitment opportunities among the top practitioners in the field of AI and beyond</li>
    </ul>

    The following are the sponsorship options we offer, although we are open to consider other suggestions:

    <table class="sponsorship_table">
      <tr>
        <th>Silver (&euro;500)</th>
