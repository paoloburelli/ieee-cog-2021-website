    <p>Games offer a fantastic domain for computational creativity, design, technology, education, social sciences and,
      undoubtedly, artificial and computational intelligence. The annual IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) seeks to
      share insights and cutting-edge research related to game technologies and design, covering scientific, technical,
      and human aspects of games.</p>
    <p>The Conference on Games (CoG) evolves from the traditional Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG) to bring
      together leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry in the field of Games, to discuss recent
      advances and explore future directions.</p>
    <p>IEEE CoG 2021 will include presentations of peer-reviewed papers, invited talks by high-profile industry and
      academic leaders, panels, posters and demos. Furthermore, this year's edition will include two new forms of
      presentations:</p>

    <ul class="dashed spaced">
      <li>Presentations of abstract submissions, this submission will not be included in the proceedings of the
        conference;
      </li>
      <li>Presentations of articles previously published in the IEEE Transactions on Games journal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We welcome papers and presentations related to all aspects of Games, including, but not limited to, the following
      broad subject areas:</p>

    <p class="tags">
      <mark>AI&nbsp;for&nbsp;Playing&nbsp;Games</mark>

            <p>The CoG 2021 Organising Committee invites proposals for competitions to be held at the conference. These
              may be completely new ones or competitions held already in the last years, possibly at other venues.
              Proposals are due by January 14th 2021, and will be reviewed based on their relevance to the CoG
              community. Please see the topics covered by the CoG conference. Competitions can be based on well-known
              games as well, but competitions based on custom-made and lesser-known games are also welcome. The
              competition needs to define a set of rules and objectives for determining the score of each player.</p>
            <p>To submit your proposal, send an email with the title "CoG 2021 Competition Proposal" to the competition
              chairs Ruck Thawonmas (<a href="mailto:ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp">ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp</a>) and Antonios
              Liapis (<a href="mailto:antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt">antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt</a>).</p>
            <p>Please, include the following information with your proposal:</p>

            <ul class="dashed">
              <li>Organisers’ names;</li>
              <li>Competition title;</li>
              <li>Web address;</li>
              <li>Description of the competition (about 200 words);</li>
              <li>Whether the competition will have several tracks or not, and if they should be considered different
                competitions or a single one.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Additionally, the following item can be submitted with the proposal or later:</p>

            <ul class="dashed">
              <li>Video of the competition/tracks (see below).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please, also note the following:</p>

            <ol class="spaced">
              <li>The IEEE CIS Student Game-Based Competition Sub-Committee (SGBC) has determined, in agreement with the
                Games TC meeting held at CIG 2017, that all competitions (including all tracks) must provide a short
                video for entrants. Competitions that do not provide this video will not be accepted at CoG 2021.
                However, submission of the video is not necessary for the proposal but can be deferred to after
                provisional acceptance of the competition. This requirement applies to both new and old competitions.
                The objective of creating these videos is to raise the general quality of our competitions and attract
                as many participants as possible by providing an easier start with the respective frameworks. The
                duration of the video is to be decided by the organizers, but it should have (English) subtitles to aid
                non-native English speakers. The content should demo concepts like how to install the required software
                packages, write an entry for the competition and submission instructions. The rationale is that if the
                whole process can be shown in less than 5 minutes, participants will feel more encouraged to participate
                and prepare a submission for the contest;
              </li>
              <li>We will of course provide certificates for all competitions and we will try to make some price money
                available, but we also encourage the organizers to look for financial sponsorship to make their
                competition more attractive;
              </li>
              <li>Competition papers. These are regular papers (up to 8 pages) that describe one or more entries to the
                competitions that are running at this year’s CIG. Competition papers need to include evaluation of the
                contribution, including (if possible) results on the same benchmark as that used by the competition, and
                comparison to other competition entries. Because the problem domain is well-known, these papers can be
                reviewed faster than regular papers. The same quality standards will apply to competition papers as to
                regular papers. Competition papers should be submitted by 28th May 2021. The competitions do not need to
                be accompanied by competition papers; a competition can run even in the absence of any submitted papers.
              </li>
            </ol>

        <p>This competition focuses on a variation of the classic Snakes game to provide an entertaining environment of studying and teaching artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Snakes is an arcade game in which two players control their respective snakes, attempting to collect the most number of apples while manoeuvring its way to avoid collisions with each other or leaving the board. Participants are requested to submit the implementation of the bot that operates its respective snake, using the API provided and simple specifications. The tournament will happen in a round-robin format, in which two participants play against each other ten times. At each match, snakes capture apples to increase their sizes. After 2 minutes, the longest snake wins; unless your opponent dies before. ;) The champion is the participant whose bot achieves the highest winning ratio among the participants. Snakes game has been designed to facilitate and encourage the use of AI, ML and other advanced computational techniques by first and second-year students in university-level courses of Computer Science.</p>

        <p>Bot Bowl III is the third AI competition in the board game Blood Bowl. The competition uses the Fantasy Football AI (FFAI) framework [1] that simulates the game with an API for scripted bots and machine learning algorithms in Python. Blood Bowl is a major challenge due to the complexity introduced by having multiple actions each turn. For more details on why we think Blood Bowl should be the next board game challenge for AI, check our CoG paper [2].

        <p>CARLE is the name of the environment for Carle's Game, and stands for Cellular Automata Reinforcement Learning Environment. This environment is a cellular automata (CA) simulator with support for arbitrary "Game of Life"-like CA based on born/survive rules applied to cells' Moore neighborhoods. It's implemented in PyTorch and runs relatively fast, nearly 10,000 CA updates with vectorization on a run-of-the-mill laptop with just 4 threads.</p> 
        <p>Agents have the ability to toggle any and all cells in a 32x32 grid in the center of the default 64x64 universe. Although formulated as a reinforcement learning environment, the environment returns no nonzero reward or done signal; participants will be challenged to exploit the environments open-endedness and add constraints and exploratory reward functions to teach agents to be curious and creative.</p>
        <p>Judging can consist of quantitative metrics such as duration of aperiodic dynamism after last toggling cells, and qualitative judging (people's choice/judging panel), and agents will be trained and tested on 4 to 8 CA rule sets with interesting characteristics. The final test round will incorporate rule sets not disclosed during training, making for a particularly strong challenge to participants.</p>

        <p>ColorShapeLinks is an AI competition for the Simplexity board game with arbitrary game dimensions. The first player to place n pieces of the same type in a row wins. In this regard, the base game, with a 6 x 7 board and n = 4, is similar to Connect Four. However, the type of piece is defined not only by color, but also by shape. Shape can be round or square. Round or white pieces offer the win to player 1, while square or red pieces do the same for player 2. Contrary to color, players start the game with pieces of both shapes. This means that a less observant player can lose in its turn, especially since shape has priority over color as a winning condition. Given this fact, as well as the arbitrary game dimensions, the challenges for the AI, namely at the level of the heuristic evaluation function, are multifold.</p>

        <p>The Dota 2 5v5 AI Competition challenges participants to code a bot that beats the Dire (destroys the Dire’s Ancient) in the shortest time possible!
        The competition runs on the original Dota 2 game, thanks to the Dota 2 5v5 Framework, that let’s you develop, deploy, and run your own python program that controls the 5 heroes in the Radiant team, against the built-in AI.</p>
        <p>Your bot will play as the Radiant. You can freely choose 5 among all the available 115 heroes for your team.</p>
        <p>Your bot will face the built-in Dire AI in a standard Dota 2 5v5 match. The heroes in the Dire team will be randomly chosen among the remaining heroes.</p>
        <p>The winner will be the fastest bot at destroying the Dire’s Ancient. The framework saves the time elapsed from the match start to the Ancient’s destruction event, which will determine the competition winner.</p>

        <p>What are promising techniques to develop general fighting-game AIs whose performances are robust against a variety of settings and opponents? As the platform, Java-based FightingICE is used which also supports Python programming and development of visual-based deep learning AIs. Two leagues (Standard and Speedrunning) are associated to each of the three character types: Zen, Garnet, and Lud where the character data of the last two characters are not revealed. Standard League considers the winner of a round as the one with the hit point (HP) above zero at the time its opponent's HP has reached zero. In Speedrunning League, the league winner of a given character type is the AI with the shortest average time to beat our sample MCTS AI. The competition winner is decided considering both leagues' results based on the 2015 Formula-1 scoring system.</p>

        <p>Following up on the idea of the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition, we propose the General Strategy Game AI competition as a new and interesting challenge. While the complexity of GVGAI games has been limited, strategy games feature search trees of exceptional breadth and depth. In comparison, to existing strategy game competitions, our competition will focus on the development of a single agent which is capable of playing multiple strategy games with varying characteristics. Those include but are not limited to, turn-based vs. real-time strategy games, completely observable vs. partial information games, and a varying set of units, levels, abilities and game-modes.</p>

        <p>More information on the competition will be available at <a href="https://gaigresearch.github.io/afm/competition">https://gaigresearch.github.io/afm/competition</a>/</p>

        <!-- <p>Since Michael Buro motivated AI research in real-time strategy games, multiple games and frameworks have been proposed and used by investigators in the field. These games, although different in themes, rules and goals, share certain characteristics that make them interesting for Game AI research. Most of the work done in this area pertains to the sub-genre of real-time strategy games (and, in particular, to Starcraft), but it is possible to find abundant research in other real-time and turn-based strategy games.</p>

Stratega allows the creation of a wide variety of turn-based and real-time strategy games using a common API for agent development. Game components are defined using a YAML configuration file which makes the creation of new games and their balancing very simple. The framework has been built with stochastic forward planning agents in mind and supports full access to a game’s forward model, which has been optimized in terms of simulation speed.</p> -->

        <p>The Tactile Games Playtest Agent competition is based on the mobile puzzle game Lily's Garden - a match-3 style puzzle game where player must complete the levels within a given number of moves.
        The objective of this competition is to accurately predict the player completion rate of these puzzle levels.
        The main research contribution of the competition is not how to optimally plan and play games but rather how to create playtesting methods that are conditioned by aggregated player behaviour data across millions of players.</p>

        <p>We provide a modified version of the game that enables simulating the main gameplay as well as data (completion rate, move limit) on the given levels.
        The participants are expected to create a playtesting agent which can match the player completion rate of a level. By using the number of moves spent by the agent to complete a given level across several attempts, the completion rate is then determined by calculating the fraction of attempts that finish within a given move limit.
        They are allowed to make use of the simulator and player data in any way they can otherwise.</p>

        <p>Their method will be evaluated on a number of held-out levels which include both previous and new mechanics. The winner will be the one that achieves the lowest mean relative error in completion rate on the evaluation levels.</p>

        <p>The Ludii AI Competition is a general game playing competition focussed on developing agents that can play a wide variety of board, dice and tile games. This competition will use Ludii, a recently developed general game system, to provide the necessary games and API. Games will be provided in the Ludii .lud game description format. The current version of Ludii includes over 500 games, with new games being added frequently. Submitted agents will play against all other competition entrants on a selected set of 20 games in a round-robin format. These games will not be named or provided to the agents beforehand. Agents will have a set amount of time, typically a few seconds, to make each move. Agents that fail to return a move, or return an illegal move, within this period will have a random move made for them. The agent that achieves the highest average win-rate across all games will win the competition.</p>

        <p>Several AI competitions organized around RTS games have been organized in the past (such as the ORTS competitions, and the StarCraft AI competitions), which has spurred a new wave of research in to RTS AI. However, as it has been reported numerous times, developing bots for RTS games such as StarCraft involves a very large amount of engineering, which often relegates the research aspects of the competition to a second plane. The microRTS competition has been created to motivate research in the basic research questions underlying the development of AI for RTS games, while minimizing the amount of engineering required to participate. Also, a key difference with respect to the StarCraft competition is that the AIs have access to a "forward model" (i.e., a simulator), with which they can simulate the effect of actions or plans, thus allowing for planning and game-tree search techniques to be developed easily. This will be the fifth edition of the competition.</p>

        <p>IEEE CoG StarCraft competitions have seen quite some progress in the development and evolution of new StarCraft bots. For the evolution of the bots, participants used various approaches for making AI bots and it has fertilized game AI and methods such as HMM, Bayesian model, CBR, Potential fields, and reinforcement learning. However, it is still quite challenging to develop AI for the game because it should handle a number of units and buildings while considering resource management and high-level tactics. The purpose of this competition is developing RTS game AI and solving challenging issues on RTS game AI such as uncertainty, real-time process, managing units. Participants are submitting the bots using BWAPI to play 1v1 StarCraft matches.</p>

        <h7><a href="https://youtu.be/3qCmoCLWazE">Video</a></h7>  

        <p>Legends of Code and Magic (LOCM) is a small implementation of a Strategy Card Game, designed to perform AI research. Its advantage over the real cardgame AI engines is that it is much simpler to handle by the agents, and thus allows testing more sophisticated algorithms and quickly implement theoretical ideas.</p>
        <p>All cards effects are deterministic, thus the nondeterminism is introduced only by the ordering of cards and unknown opponent's deck. The game board consists of two lines (similarly as in TES:Legends), so it favors deeper strategic thinking. Also, LOCM is based on the fair arena mode, i.e., before every game, both players create their decks secretly from the symmetrical yet limited choices. Because of that, the deckbuilding is dynamic and cannot be simply reduced to using human-created top-meta decks.</p>
        <p>This competition aims to play the same role for Hearthstone AI Competition as microRTS plays for various StarCraft AI contests. Encourage advanced research, free of drawbacks of working with the full-fledged game. In this domain, it means i.a. embedding deckbuilding into the game itself (limiting the usage of premade decks), and allowing efficient search beyond the one turn depth.</p>
        <p>The contest is based on the LOCM 1.2, the same as in CEC 2019 Competition. One-lane, 1.0 version of the game, has been used for CodinGame contest in August 2018.</p>
