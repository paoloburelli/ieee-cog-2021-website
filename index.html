    <p>Games offer a fantastic domain for computational creativity, design, technology, education, social sciences and,
      undoubtedly, artificial and computational intelligence. The annual IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) seeks to
      share insights and cutting-edge research related to game technologies and design, covering scientific, technical,
      and human aspects of games.</p>
    <p>The Conference on Games (CoG) evolves from the traditional Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG) to bring
      together leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry in the field of Games, to discuss recent
      advances and explore future directions.</p>
    <p>IEEE CoG 2021 will include presentations of peer-reviewed papers, invited talks by high-profile industry and
      academic leaders, panels, posters and demos. Furthermore, this year's edition will include two new forms of
      presentations:</p>

    <ul class="dashed spaced">
      <li>Presentations of abstract submissions, this submission will not be included in the proceedings of the
        conference;
      </li>
      <li>Presentations of articles previously published in the IEEE Transactions on Games journal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We welcome papers and presentations related to all aspects of Games, including, but not limited to, the following
      broad subject areas:</p>

              this broad scope.</p>
            <p>Typically, tutorials are expected to run for 1.5 hours, but longer ones will also be considered. The

            <p>The CoG 2021 Organising Committee invites proposals for competitions to be held at the conference. These
              may be completely new ones or competitions held already in the last years, possibly at other venues.
              Proposals are due by January 14th 2021, and will be reviewed based on their relevance to the CoG
              community. Please see the topics covered by the CoG conference. Competitions can be based on well-known
              games as well, but competitions based on custom-made and lesser-known games are also welcome. The
              competition needs to define a set of rules and objectives for determining the score of each player.</p>
            <p>To submit your proposal, send an email with the title "CoG 2021 Competition Proposal" to the competition
              chairs Ruck Thawonmas (<a href="mailto:ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp">ruck@is.ritsumei.ac.jp</a>) and Antonios
              Liapis (<a href="mailto:antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt">antonios.liapis@um.edu.mt</a>).</p>
            <p>Please, include the following information with your proposal:</p>

            <ul class="dashed">
              <li>Organisers’ names;</li>
              <li>Competition title;</li>
              <li>Web address;</li>
              <li>Description of the competition (about 200 words);</li>
              <li>Whether the competition will have several tracks or not, and if they should be considered different
                competitions or a single one.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Additionally, the following item can be submitted with the proposal or later:</p>

            <ul class="dashed">
              <li>Video of the competition/tracks (see below).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please, also note the following:</p>

            <ol class="spaced">
              <li>The IEEE CIS Student Game-Based Competition Sub-Committee (SGBC) has determined, in agreement with the
                Games TC meeting held at CIG 2017, that all competitions (including all tracks) must provide a short
                video for entrants. Competitions that do not provide this video will not be accepted at CoG 2021.
                However, submission of the video is not necessary for the proposal but can be deferred to after
                provisional acceptance of the competition. This requirement applies to both new and old competitions.
                The objective of creating these videos is to raise the general quality of our competitions and attract
                as many participants as possible by providing an easier start with the respective frameworks. The
                duration of the video is to be decided by the organizers, but it should have (English) subtitles to aid
                non-native English speakers. The content should demo concepts like how to install the required software
                packages, write an entry for the competition and submission instructions. The rationale is that if the
                whole process can be shown in less than 5 minutes, participants will feel more encouraged to participate
                and prepare a submission for the contest;
              </li>
              <li>We will of course provide certificates for all competitions and we will try to make some price money
                available, but we also encourage the organizers to look for financial sponsorship to make their
                competition more attractive;
              </li>
              <li>Competition papers. These are regular papers (up to 8 pages) that describe one or more entries to the
                competitions that are running at this year’s CIG. Competition papers need to include evaluation of the
                contribution, including (if possible) results on the same benchmark as that used by the competition, and
                comparison to other competition entries. Because the problem domain is well-known, these papers can be
                reviewed faster than regular papers. The same quality standards will apply to competition papers as to
                regular papers. Competition papers should be submitted by 28th May 2021. The competitions do not need to
                be accompanied by competition papers; a competition can run even in the absence of any submitted papers.
              </li>

            <p><strong>Vision papers</strong> (8 pages) describe a vision for the future of the Games field or some part
              of it, are based on extensive research and include a comprehensive bibliography. Standards for competition
              papers are as high as for other CoG papers, and standards for vision papers are higher.</p>
            <p><strong>Demo papers</strong> (2 pages) describe work in progress and will be presented during a demo
              session.</p>
            <p>Short, competition, vision and demo papers, similarly to full papers, will be published by IEEE in the
              proceedings of the conference.</p>

            <h6><strong>Extended Abstracts.</strong> Deadline on May 28th 2021</h6>
            <p>This edition of IEEE CoG welcomes extended abstract submissions by researchers and practitioners to
              present their research findings. The extended abstract submission is intended to accommodate researchers
              who want to participate and share their findings at CoG but come from disciplines that traditionally do
              not publish their work in conference proceedings.</p>
            <p>Extended abstracts should be between 750 and 1500 words including references. Works submitted in this
              format will not be published in the conference proceedings.</p>

            <h6><strong>Journal Paper Presentations.</strong> Deadline on May 28th 2021</h6>
            <p>From this year, the IEEE CoG conference will welcome proposals for presentation of articles previously
              published in the IEEE Transactions on Games journal. For anyone interested in presenting their published
              work, you will need to submit a copy of the published paper in the appropriate track.</p>

            <h6><strong>Industry talks.</strong> Deadline on May 28th 2021</h6>
            <p>We welcome talk proposals from the games industry that wish to present their work on the areas covered in
              this conference. We are interested in presentations about research prototypes, commercial products,
              indie/mobile/AAA games, AR/VR applications, etc., as well as participation on poster sessions and
              discussion panels. From these talk proposals do not require the submission of a written manuscript to be
              accepted at the conference.</p>

            <blockquote>All page/word limits for all submission types include references and appendices. We plan to
              invite the principle authors to submit
              an extended version of their papers to the IEEE Transactions on Games (ToG). More details on this matter
              will be given later. All deadline times are anywhere on earth.
